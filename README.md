Pomodoro Doro is a simple and helpful pomodoro timer developed to assist you in time management and task execution. 
The Pomodoro Technique was created by the italian Francesco Cirillo, in the late 1980s, for a more productive way to work  and study. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato'.
